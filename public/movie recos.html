<h1>Ginnie's Movie Guide</h1>
<h2>My best movie recommendations of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fair Play</h3>
<p>I loved Emily's character. She's strong, independent and a goal-getter but also loves genuinely. I loved how, in the end, she handled herself gracefully despite being hurt and betrayed by a narcissistic man.</p>

<h3>Finding Nemo</h3>
<p>Loved the songs! This movie always brings me back my childhood memories. This is the first movie that taught me to never give up on what or who you love.</p>

<h3>50 First Dates</h3>
<p>I'm a romcom addict and this one's my all time favorite. It is funny, romantic, the actors are suberp and the setting is a dream.</p>
